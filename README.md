# Goals of at-sea data scripts

### This repository contains script to assess the following while the eastern and northern Bering Sea bottom trawl surveys are underway: 
- The proportion of female red king crab having not yet completed the molt/mate cycle. A 10% threshold of females not yet molted/mated triggers a later resampling in Bristol Bay
- Look up historical catch data for a given station and/or year of interest
- Develop preliminary at-sea estimates of number of snow crab and tanner crab caught. These estimates are sent to stock assessment authors as updates throughout the EBS survey
- Test a pilot special project addressing the efficacy of a bin subsampling protocol. This pilot special project was run on Legs 3 and 4 of the 2023 bottom trawl survey
